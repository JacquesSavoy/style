Exercise #2.3: Explore Zipf's law for words having a low frequency


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load, tokenize, and subdivide the corpus (see SolutionEx1.r).

Step 2:  Subdivide the training corpus into three parts according to the three authors.

Step 3:  Explore Zipf's law for each author.
         Indicate the number of hapax (words appearing once) and their proportion.
         Do the same for the words appearing twice (dis) or three times.
         Indicate the number of words occurring five times or less and their proportion.

You can compare your results with the values reported in Table 2.4 in the book.
