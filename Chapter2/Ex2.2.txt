Exercises #2.2: Provide some overall statistics about the corpus


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load, tokenize and subdivide the corpus (see SolutionEx1.r).

Step 2:  Identify the top 50 most frequent words in the training part.
         Return the list of those words with their absolute frequency in the corpus.

Step 3:  Identify the entire vocabulary present in the training set.
         Indicate the vocabulary size and the total number of tokens.

Step 4:  Indicate the vocabulary size and the total number of tokens per author
         Indicate the top ten most frequent words per author
             with their absolute and relative frequency.

         You can verify the Zipf's law for the most frequent words.


You can compare your results with the values reported in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 in the book.
