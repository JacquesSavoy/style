Exercises #2.4: Compute some vocabulary richness measures per author


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load, tokenize, and subdivide the corpus (see SolutionEx1.r)

Step 2:  Subdivide the training corpus into three parts according to the three authors
         (see SolutionEx2.r).

Step 3:  After computing the vocabulary size, the number of tokens,
         the number of hapax and dis, 
         compute the TTR ratio for each author
         then the Guiraud's R
                  Herdan's C 
                  hapax density, and
                  Sichel's S
     

You can compare your results with the values reported in Table 2.5 in the book.
