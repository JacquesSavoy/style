Exercise #4.2: Applying the t-test

The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load the dataset SystemAB.txt.

Step 2:  Compute the mean performance for System A and B.
         Compute the variance for both systems.

Step 3:  Apply the t-test, assuming the variances are equal, and
            H0: System A performs at the same level than System B.
         What is your conclusion?

Step 4:  Apply the t-test, assuming that the variances are not equal, and
            H0: System A performs at the same level than System B.
         What is your conclusion?

Step 5:  Apply the t-test, assuming that the variances are equal, and
            H0: System A must perform better than System B.
         What is your conclusion?
