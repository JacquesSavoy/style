# Exercise 4.2:  Statistical analysis and test
#
# The t-test 
#
#  H0: Assuming that:
#     System A performs at the same level than System B
#
options(digits=5)
#
# STEP 1:  Load the dataset
#
myData <- read.table("SystemAB.txt", header=T)
# View the data
myData
#
# To simplify the calls with the different variables 
# included in the dataframe myData.
attach(myData)
#
# STEP 2
# The mean performance of the two systems
#
mean(A)
mean(B)
# And the variances
var(A)
var(B)
#
# System A presents a higher mean (a better effectiveness)
#   and a higher variance
#
#
# STEP 3
# Apply the t-test, 
# Two-sided test, same variance
#
t.test(A, B, var.equal=TRUE, alternative="two.sided")
#
# The p-value is low and lower than 5%
# The two systems do not perfrom at the same level
#
# STEP 4
# Assuming that the two variances are not the same
#
t.test(A, B, var.equal=FALSE, alternative="two.sided")
#
# The p-value is higher but still lower than 5%
#
# STEP 5
# One can assume that System A must perfom better than B
# One-sided test.
#
t.test(A, B, var.equal=TRUE, alternative="greater")
#
# The p-value is clearly lower than 5%
