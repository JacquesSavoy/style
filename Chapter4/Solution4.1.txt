# Exercise 4.1:  Statistical analysis and test
#
# Sign test 
#
#  H0: Assuming that:
#     System A performs at the same level than System B
#
options(digits=4)
#
# STEP 1: Load the dataset
#
myData <- read.table("SystemAB.txt", header=T)
dim(myData)
# View the data
myData[1:5,]
#
# STEP 2
# How many experiments produce a different output for both systems?
n <- sum(myData$A != myData$B)
#
# STEP 3
# How many times System A performs better than System B?
na <- sum(myData$A > myData$B)
#
# STEP 4
# Apply the sign test (prob = 0.5)
# if for n experiemnts, we obtain na times a better result for A ...
#
binom.test(na, n, 0.5)
# The p-value < 0.05 (or 5%).
# The performance difference is stastistically significant.
#
# STEP 5
# And when n = 20 and na = 9
# We have more or less the same number for experiements
#    for which A is better than B
binom.test(9, 20, 0.5)
#
# The p-value is high (0.8) and > than 0.05.
# The performance difference is not significant.
#
# And with n = 20, na = 2
binom.test(2, 20, 0.5)
#
# The p-value is very low (0.0004) and < than 0.05.
# The performance difference is statistically significant.
