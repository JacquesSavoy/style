Exercises #4.1: Applying the Sign test

The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load the dataset SystemAB.txt.

Step 2:  Count the number of experiments producing different results for System A and B.

Step 3:  Count the number of times that System A performs better than System B.

Step 4:  Apply the sign text
         Under H0, this is a binom.test with a probability of success = 0.5
         What is your conclusion?

Step 5:  And if we had 20 experiments, with 9 times A performing better than B?
         And if we had 20 experiments, with 2 times A performing better than B?
