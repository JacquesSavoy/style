Exercise #3.4: Step by Step Delta computation
                Instances-based computation


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors.

Step 3:  Extract the top 50 most frequent word-types.
         Represent each article with its relative frequencies.

Step 4:  For each selected word-type, compute the mean and standard deviation.
         Represent each chosen article according to its Z scores.

Step 5:  Compute the Delta score for each article
         based on the top 50 most frequent word-types.
