Exercises #3.3: Step by Step Delta computation
                Instances-based computation


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors

Step 3:  Extract the top 50 most frequent word-type
         Represent each article with their relative frequencies

Step 4:  For each selected word-types, compute the mean and standard deviation
         Represent each chosen articles according to their Z scores

Step 5:  Compute the Delta score for each articles
         Based on the top 50 most frequent word-types
