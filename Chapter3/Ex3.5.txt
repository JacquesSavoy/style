Exercise #3.5: Step by step computation of the KLD model


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors.

Step 3:  Extract articles H59, H60, H61, H65, M37, M38, M47, M48 and Q54.
         Select six word-types (the, of, to, in, and, a)
         to represent those articles and the query text with relative frequencies,
         but the length corresponds to the total number of the six words.


Step 4:  Define a user-defined function to compute the KLD between two vectors.
         Control that each vector contains probabilities and
            the sum of their components must be 1.0.


Step 5:  Compute the KLD between the training articles and the query text.
         Display the KLD values for each article in the training set.
         Which is the achieved attribution?
