Exercise #3.6: Difference measures of distance / similarity


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors.

Step 3:  Extract articles H59, H60, H61, H65, M37, M38, M47, M48 and Q54.
         Select six word-types (the, of, to, in, and, a)
         to represent those articles and the query text with relative frequencies,
         but the length corresponds to the total number of the six words.


Step 4:  Define a user-defined function to compute the distance
         according to the Manhattan and Euclidian functions.
         Compute the similarity according to the cosine.

Step 5:  Is it always the same training article that is the closest or
         presents the highest similarity with Q54?
