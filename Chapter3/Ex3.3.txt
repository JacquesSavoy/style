Exercise #3.3: Step by Step Delta computation
                Instances-based computation


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors.

Step 3:  Extract articles H59, H60, H61, H65, M37, M38, M47, M48 and Q54.
         Select six word-types (the, of, to, in, and, a)
         to represent those articles with relative frequencies.


Step 4:  For each selected word-type, compute the mean and standard deviation.
         Represent each chosen article according to its Z scores.

Step 5:  Compute the Delta score for each article.
         You can solve this by writing a user-defined function
         (e.g., define the Manhattan distance).
