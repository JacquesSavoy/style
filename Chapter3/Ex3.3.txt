Exercises #3.3: Step by Step Delta computation
                Instances-based computation


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors

Step 3:  Extract articles H59, H60, H61, H65, M37, M38, M47, M48 and Q54
         Select six word-types (the, of, to, in, and, a)
         To represent those articles with relative frequencies

Step 4:  For each selected word-types, compute the mean and standard deviation
         Represent each chosen articles according to their Z scores

Step 5:  Compute the Delta score for each articles
         You can solve this by writing a user-defined function
