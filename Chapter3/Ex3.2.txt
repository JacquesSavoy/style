Exercise #3.2: Step by Step Delta computation
                Profile-based computation


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the authors.

Step 3:  Extract articles H59, H60, H61, H65, M37, M38, M47, M48 and Q54.
         Select six word-types (the, of, to, in, and, a)
         to represent those articles with relative frequencies.


Step 4:  Generate the two authors' profiles.
         Represent them with their Z scores.

Step 5:  Compute the Delta score for the two authors' profiles.
