Exercise #5.3: Text representation based on n-grams of words


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus into the training set (Hamilton & Madison)
            and for the test set, only Q54 and Q55.

Step 3:  Generate a representation based on bigrams of words
            for both the training and test samples.
         Select as final feature set, the 200 most frequent bigrams of words.

Step 4:  Define the Manhattan distance function.

Step 5:  Apply the distance function to the two articles in the test set
            and as output, present only the closest article with the distance.
