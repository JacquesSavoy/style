Exercises #5.1: Text representation based on n-grams of letters


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenize the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the training set (Hamilton & Madison)
         and for the test set, only Q54 and Q55

Step 3:  Generate a representation based on trigrams of letters
            for both the training and test samples.
         Select as final feature set, the 200 most frequent letter trigrams.

Step 4:  Write two user-defined functions to compute the Manhattan and Euclidian distance.

Step 5:  Apply the two distance functions to the two articles in the test set
            and consider all texts in the training set.

Step 6:  As output, present just the closest article with the distance.
