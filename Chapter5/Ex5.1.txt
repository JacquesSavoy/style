Exercises #5.1: Text representation based on n-grams of letters


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenise the corpus from the specified data directory

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the training set (Hamilton & Madison)
         and for the test set, only Q54 and Q55

Step 3:  Generate a representation based on trigrams of letters
         for both the training and test samples
         Select as final feature set, the 200 most frequent trigrams of letters

Step 4:  Define two functions to compute the Manhattan and Euclidian distance

Step 5:  Apply the two distance functions to the two articles in the test set
         And consider all texts in the training set

step 6:  As output, present just the closest article with the distance.
