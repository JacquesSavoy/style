Chapter 5 focus on selecting features for text categorisation based on style.


The exercises related to this chapter are presenting n-grams of letters 
with different distance measures.    


The roadmap is the following.

Exercise #5.1:  Selecting all articles written by Hamilton & Madison.
                Select as query articles Q54 and Q55.

                Represent the texts with trigrams of letters.
                Compute the distance and select the closest training article
                  for each test text.  


Exercise #5.2:  Using all training and test articles
                Limited to Hamilton & Madison.

                Represent each paper with letter trigrams.

                Apply the Delta model with
                50, 100, 150,... 500 most frequent letter trigrams.


Exercise #5.3:  Similar to Exercise 5.1, but the features are bigrams of words.
