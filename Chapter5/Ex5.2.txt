Exercises #5.2: Text representation based on n-grams of letters


The roadmap is the following.


Step 1:  Load and tokenize the corpus from the specified data directory.

Step 2:  Subdivide the corpus according to the training set (Hamilton & Madison)
            and for all disputed articles.


Step 3:  Generate a representation based on trigrams of letters
            for both the training and test samples.
         Select as final feature set, the 500 most frequent trigrams of letters.


Step 4:  Apply the Delta model (with STYLO) to generate the decision for all 
         disputed articles with the number of features varying from 50 to 500.
