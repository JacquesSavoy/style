Chapter 6 presents four machine learning models.

The available examples are the following.

k-NN:  Six word-types have been selected to discriminate between three authors.
       Three normalisation procedures are proposed, and Laplace smoothing is also applied.

Naïve Bayes:  With this example, the number of possible authors is limited to two (Hamilton & Madison).
              As features, the absolute frequency of two word-types is provided as well as
                 four Boolean features indicating whether or not a given term is present in the
                 corresponding newspaper article.  

SVM:  The example used only three word-types and assumes that the disputed papers
         could have been written by Hamilton or Madison.

Logistic regression:  In this example, the task is to identify whether a set of tweets
                 have been sent by bots of humans.  100 instances are provided. 
              As features, the length of the 100 tweets, and the number of emojis, emojis with a face, 
                 mentions, and hyperlinks are given.
              In this dataset, 61 set of tweets have been generated by machine, and 39 by humans.



In the associated './Data' folder, one can find the datasets used, namely:

   FederalistFreq.txt      --> k_NN
   FederalistFreqMixed.txt --> naïveBayes
   FederalistFung.txt      --> k_NN
   ExampleBotHuman.txt     --> logistic regression

In addition, the file 'FederalistFreqFull.txt' contains 12 word-types with their absolute frequency
in all articles in the Federalist papers corpus.  This file can be used to explore variants of
the four machine learning strategies.
